== Description ==

This plugin is used for BuddyPress to add TinyChat to Groups, 
Group creators can enable this in the admin section,
This is instant fullscreen and has SoundCloud enabled, 
This also has Smileys enabled using my JavaScript file as TinyChat have now disabled them by default, Tinychat seem to of disabled YouTube from working on external servers.


== Installation ==

* Upload the plugin to your plugins folder then activate,
* Create a new group and click enable group chat or go to an already created group and enable group chat in the admin area.

== Screenshots ==

* To use just enter Groups and create a new group and follow the steps or use one already and go to settings.
* Make sure there is a tick in the box to enable the chat then save.
* You'll be notified that it's saved.
* Once enabled it'll then show the "Group Chat" link in your chosen group(s).
* This is the TinyChat load screen, If you don't see this then check that you have "Adobe Flash Player installed" (Info is on FAQ). 
* Once it's loaded then just enter your username, Just use "Guest" as the Facebook/Twitter are associated with the TinyChat domain only.

== Notes ==

The room name is now domain/groupname
or go to http://www.ruddernation.net/*Group Name*
Example: http://www.mydomain.com/groups/groupname/ This will output the room name to *Group Name*.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Q. Can I use this if I'm not logged in?
* A. No, You have to be logged in and you have to be a member of the group.

* Q. The chat is not loading for me.
* A. Check to see if you have the Adobe flash player installed (http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html) and JavaScript enabled in your browser.
