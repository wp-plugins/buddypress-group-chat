== Description ==

This plugin is used for BuddyPress to add TinyChat to Groups, 
Group creators can enable this in the admin section,
This is instant fullscreen and has YouTube/SoundCloud enabled, 
This also has Smileys enabled using my JavaScript file as TinyChat have now disabled them by default.


== Installation ==

* Upload the plugin to your plugins folder then activate,
* Create a new group and click enable group chat or go to an already created group and enable group chat in the admin area.

== Screenshots ==

* To use just enter Groups and create a new group and follow the steps or use one already and go to settings.
* Make sure there is a tick in the box to enable the chat then save.
* You'll be notified that it's saved.
* Once enabled it'll then show the "Group Chat" link in your chosen group(s).
* This is the TinyChat load screen, If you don't see this then check that you have "Adobe Flash Player installed" (Info is on FAQ). 
* Once it's loaded then just enter your username, Just use "Guest" as the Facebook/Twitter are associated with the TinyChat domain only.

== Notes ==

The room name is now domain/groupname
or go to http://www.ruddernation.net/*Group Name*
Example: http://www.mydomain.com/groups/groupname/ This will output the room name to *Group Name*.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Q. Can I use this if I'm not logged in?
* A. No, You have to be logged in and you have to be a member of the group.

* Q. The chat is not loading for me.
* A. Check to see if you have the Adobe flash player installed (http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html) and JavaScript enabled in your browser.
