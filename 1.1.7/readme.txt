== Description ==

This plugin is used for BuddyPress to add TinyChat to Groups,

This also has Smileys enabled using my JavaScript file as TinyChat have now disabled them by default.

* Create a new group and click enable group chat or go to an already created group and enable group chat in the admin area.

== Notes ==

The room names take the name of group, So you could go to Tinychat and add the group name for chat with ads 
or go to http://www.ruddernation.net/*Group Name*
Example: http://www.mydomain.com/groups/groupname/ This will output the room name to *Group Name*.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Q. Can I use this if I'm not logged in?
* A. No, You have to be logged in and you have to be a member of the group.

* Q. The chat is not loading for me.
* A. Check to see if you have the Adobe flash player installed (http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer) and JavaScript enabled in your browser.
